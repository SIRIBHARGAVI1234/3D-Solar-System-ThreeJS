# 3D Solar System Simulation with 8 Planets

## Project Description

This project is a 3D visualization of the Solar System built using Three.js. It features the Sun at the center with eight planets orbiting around it. Users can interact with the simulation by adjusting the orbital speed of each planet using sliders and can pause or resume the animation at any time.

## Key Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of the Sun and all eight planets
- Starry background to create a space-like atmosphere
- Orbit rings visualizing each planetâ€™s path
- Interactive control panel for adjusting the speed of planetary orbits in real-time
- Pause and resume functionality for the animation
- Labels displaying the names of the planets for better user understanding

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser

## How to Run
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
2. Use the sliders in the control panel to change the orbital speeds of the planets dynamically.
3. Click the **Pause** button to pause or resume the solar system animation.

## Additional Notes

I am still learning JavaScript and 3D programming concepts. This project was developed with guidance and support from various online tutorials, documentation, and examples.
